# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

Help Martha who is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for their new investment. Since the data is not ideal and there is no known output for that, I used unsupervised 
machine learning models based on the following methods:

  - Preprocessing the Data for PCA
  - Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
  - Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
  - Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Resources

- Data Source: crypto_data.csv

- Software: Python 3.8.3, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3


## Results

#### Reducing the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm

#### Creating an elbow curve to find the best value for K using K-means algorithm

#### running the K-means algorithm to predict the K(K=4) clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data
